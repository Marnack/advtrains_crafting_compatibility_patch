#	Specify if the patch should be applied when the mod is initialized. This
#	setting should typically be enabled. Only in rare cases where another mod
#	is using this mod's API to customize the patch behavior might this

#	This setting is intended to keep broken crafting recipes from appearing in
#	the crafting guide. When enabled, the original recipes for advtrains will
#	be removed when replacement recipes are added. If disabled, the advtrains
#	recipes that require unavailable items will not be removed. In some cases,
#	it may be necessary to disable this setting if another mod will also be
#	updating the advtrains crafting recipes or adding alternate recipes for
#	advtrains items.
advtrains_crafting_compatibility_patch_remove_original_recipes (Remove original "Minetest Game" based recipes) bool true

#	Update the recipes for advtrains tools.
#	If disabled, the original recipes for tools will not be changed or removed.

#	Update the recipes for advtrains track and track related items.
#	If disabled, the original recipes for track and track related items will
#	not be changed or removed.

#	Update the recipes for advtrains wagon and locomotive parts.

#	be changed or removed.

#	Update the recipes for advtrains signs and signals.

#	changed or removed.

#	Add the nodes and recipes for advtrains train station platforms.
#	If disabled, the advtrains platform nodes and their recipes will not be
#	added.
#	This is disabled by default because there is a small risk that a future
#	update of advtrains or one of the game mods could break this patch such
#	that the platform nodes created by this mod become "Unknown Item" nodes.
#	Only enable this setting if testing or if you are comfortable handling
#	"Unknown Item" nodes (4 per platform material, typically 8 in total) if
#	such a breakage occurs.

#	likely only be needed when investigating an issue that might be related
#	to this mod or when developing a new mod that uses this mod's API to
#	alter its behavior.
